# Rick & Morty meet Apollo Client

This is a demo application built with [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to show the power of Apollo Client within the Vue application.

- [`master`](https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina/apollo-presentation) - a finished example with local state management on Apollo Client
- [`initial`](https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina/apollo-presentation/tree/initial) - starting code that already has application UI, correct webpack loaders, set up Apollo Client and has all queries/mutations on `graphql` folder. However, you still need to write Apollo code in Vue components, as well as create correct resolvers for local queries
- [`rest`](https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina/apollo-presentation/tree/rest) - fancy experiment with using REST API endpoint wrapped with Apollo Client
- [`mock`](https://github.com/NataliaTepluhina/apollo-presentation/tree/mock) - mocking API response with Apollo Resolver
